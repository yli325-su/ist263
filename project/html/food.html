                <p>As a well-know ancient city of history and culture, Beijing traditional food also has a long historical standing. It is a mix of Han, Hui, Mongolian and Manchu as well as the royal cuisine of Ming and Qing Dynasties. Beijing food features many varieties and unique taste. Fermented Soya-bean milk, fried liver, luzhu, noodles with soybean paste are the most characteristics. Some specials made by some time-honored restaurants such as pea flour cake, fried chop rice cake, steamed rice cakes with sweet stuffing, fried butter cake, and so on could be seen in food stalls and restaurants.</p>

                    <h3>Luzhu Huoshao 卤煮火烧</h3>
                    <p>With a name that literally translates to “stewed bread,” unsuspecting diners may be surprised to find that bread floating in a steaming-hot soup alongside intestines, lungs, and tofu. That may be enough to keep many tourists at a safe distance, but for Beijingers, this traditional local delicacy is beloved as a hearty meal–perfect for those looking for a second wind after a long day at work, or to warm up on a cold winter’s day.  A humble meal with lofty aspirations, luzhu huoshao is said to have emerged in the late 1800s, as an imitation of a fabled imperial dish, made with ingredients that commoners could afford. Today, luzhu remains a signature Beijing dish almost impossible to find outside the city.</p>
